  <h1>Burst Pipe Cleanup in Omaha, Nebraska</h1>

  <p>Frozen and burst pipes are a common cause of severe water damage in Omaha, especially during winter freeze-thaw cycles. When a pipe bursts, water can spread rapidly through walls, ceilings, and flooring.</p>

  <h2>What Causes Pipes to Burst in Omaha?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Extreme winter temperature drops</li>
    <li>Rapid freezing and expansion inside pipes</li>
    <li>Poor insulation in older homes</li>
    <li>Unheated basements or crawlspaces</li>
    <li>Aging plumbing systems</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When water freezes, it expands. That expansion increases pressure inside the pipe until it cracks or ruptures.</p>

  <h2>Immediate Steps After a Pipe Bursts</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Shut off the main water supply immediately</li>
    <li>Turn off electricity in affected areas if safe</li>
    <li>Remove standing water if possible</li>
    <li>Move belongings to a dry location</li>
    <li>Document visible damage for insurance</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Fast response reduces structural damage and helps prevent mold growth, which can begin within 24–48 hours in damp conditions.</p>
