        <p><strong>1) Platform Role / No Guarantee:</strong>
        Platform is a referral and lead-generation service only. Platform makes no
        guarantees regarding the quality, safety, legality, timing, pricing, or outcome
        of Contractor’s work. Contractor is solely responsible for all services performed.</p>

        <p><strong>2) Referral Model & Compensation:</strong>
        Contractor agrees to pay Platform:
        (a) a <strong>$150 referral fee</strong> for each <strong>Job Start</strong>, due within <strong>five (5) business days</strong> of Job Start; and
        (b) an additional fee equal to <strong>ten percent (10%) of all gross funds actually received from the customer</strong>
        for services related to the referred lead, due within <strong>five (5) business days</strong> of receiving such funds.</p>

        <p><strong>3) Referred Lead Defined (NEW):</strong>
        A <strong>“Referred Lead”</strong> means any customer contact initiated or routed through Platform-controlled
        web forms, email forwarding, text/message forwarding, lead-routing, or other Platform-originated
        referral communication, including any customer who references Platform when contacting Contractor.</p>

        <p><strong>4) Job Start Defined:</strong>
        A Job Start occurs when the customer authorizes paid work, signs a service agreement,
        pays a deposit, or Contractor schedules work to begin — whichever occurs first.</p>

        <p><strong>5) Completion Defined:</strong>
        Completion occurs when the contracted services are substantially completed and Contractor
        receives payment from the customer in whole or in part.</p>

        <p><strong>6) Reporting Requirement:</strong>
        Contractor must notify Platform within twenty-four (24) hours if a Referred Lead
        does not result in a Job Start, and must also report Completion within twenty-four (24) hours.
        Failure to notify constitutes acknowledgment that applicable referral fees are owed.</p>

        <p><strong>7) Payment Terms:</strong>
        The $150 Job Start fee is due within five (5) business days of Job Start.
        The 10% Completion fee is due within five (5) business days of Contractor receiving customer funds.</p>

        <p><strong>8) Payment Method (NEW):</strong>
        Referral fees shall be paid electronically via invoice payment link or other method designated by Platform.</p>

        <p><strong>9) Late Payments / Suspension (NEW):</strong>
        Any referral fee not paid within five (5) business days shall accrue interest at
        <strong>1.5% per month</strong> (or the maximum allowed by law) until paid. Platform may suspend or terminate
        future referrals for non-payment.</p>

        <p><strong>10) Audit & Recordkeeping (NEW):</strong>
        Contractor agrees to maintain accurate books and records relating to Referred Leads and resulting
        services for a minimum of <strong>twelve (12) months</strong> and shall provide reasonable documentation upon written
        request for verification of Job Start or Completion status.</p>

        <p><strong>11) Non-Circumvention (NEW):</strong>
        Contractor agrees not to avoid payment by redirecting, delaying, reclassifying, splitting invoices,
        or otherwise structuring services to avoid classification as a Job Start or Completion for any Referred Lead.</p>

        <p><strong>12) Independent Contractor / No Partnership:</strong>
        Contractor is an independent business and not an employee, partner, agent,
        joint venturer, or representative of Platform. Contractor is responsible for
        its own taxes, tools, labor, insurance, and workers’ compensation.</p>

        <p><strong>13) Credential & Insurance Requirements:</strong>
        Contractor represents that it maintains all licenses, permits, and insurance
        required to legally and safely perform its services, including general liability
        insurance where applicable.</p>

        <p><strong>14) Proof Upon Request:</strong>
        Contractor agrees to provide proof of credentials or insurance upon request.
        Failure to do so may result in suspension or termination of referrals.</p>

        <p><strong>15) High-Risk Work:</strong>
        For water mitigation, restoration, tree removal, or storm-related work, active
        insurance is a condition of receiving referrals.</p>

        <p><strong>16) No Control Over Work:</strong>
        Platform does not control pricing, scheduling, methods, labor, materials, or
        customer communications.</p>

        <p><strong>17) Customer Relationship:</strong>
        Any agreement for services exists solely between Contractor and the customer.
        Platform is not a party to such agreements.</p>

        <p><strong>18) Indemnification:</strong>
        Contractor agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Platform and Company
        from any claims, damages, or liabilities arising from Contractor’s work.</p>

        <p><strong>19) Limitation of Liability:</strong>
        Platform’s total liability shall not exceed referral fees paid during the
        preceding three (3) months.</p>

        <p><strong>20) Dispute Resolution / Arbitration:</strong>
        Any dispute arising from this Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration
        in Nebraska under AAA rules, and not in court, except either party may bring an
        individual claim in small claims court if eligible.</p>

        <p><strong>21) Governing Law:</strong>
        This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Nebraska.</p>

        <p><strong>22) Electronic Signature & Binding Agreement:</strong>
        By submitting this form, Contractor affirms it has authority to bind the business entity,
        has read and agrees to all terms, and consents to electronic contracting and signature under
        the U.S. ESIGN Act. Contractor agrees the typed name and submission constitute a legally binding signature.
        Contractor understands this submission records timestamp, IP address (when available), and device/user-agent
        information as part of the contractual record.</p>

        <p><strong>23) Entire Agreement:</strong>
        This document constitutes the entire agreement between the parties.</p>
